# Sastantua
A project done during the C Piscine in 42 Silicon Valley that creates an ASCII Sastantua pyramid with a inputted number of levels.

Differences from the PDF:
---
-Made a Makefile to create a binary file that mimics what the output is on the last page
-Made a "main" function in the "sastantua.c" file that uses the "printf" and "atoi" functions in order to replicate the binary file
-Put the ".c" files in a folder called "srcs" and the ".h" files in a folder called "includes" for organizational purposes
-Removed the directory ex00 and put its contents in the main directory
